feat: Part 4 - Analytics, Notifications, WebSocket, IoT, and Background Jobs

Part 4 Final Implementation - Backend

Analytics & Reporting:
- Add GET /api/v1/analytics/dashboard endpoint for admin dashboard statistics
- Add GET /api/v1/analytics/academic-performance endpoint with GPA analysis, grade distribution, top/at-risk students
- Add GET /api/v1/analytics/attendance endpoint with course attendance rates, trends, critical absence tracking
- Add GET /api/v1/analytics/meal-usage endpoint with daily counts, cafeteria utilization, peak hours, revenue
- Add GET /api/v1/analytics/events endpoint with popular events, registration/check-in rates, category breakdown
- Add GET /api/v1/analytics/export/:type endpoint for Excel/CSV report export

Enhanced Notification System:
- Add GET /api/v1/notifications endpoint with pagination, filtering, and sorting
- Add PUT /api/v1/notifications/:id/read endpoint to mark notifications as read
- Add PUT /api/v1/notifications/mark-all-read endpoint
- Add DELETE /api/v1/notifications/:id endpoint
- Add GET /api/v1/notifications/preferences endpoint
- Add PUT /api/v1/notifications/preferences endpoint with email/push/SMS channel preferences
- Implement createNotification helper method for system-wide notifications

WebSocket Implementation:
- Add Socket.io server setup with authentication middleware
- Implement real-time notification broadcasting
- Add real-time attendance updates for faculty dashboard
- Add real-time sensor data streaming (bonus)
- Support user-specific and role-based rooms

IoT Sensor Integration (Bonus):
- Add GET /api/v1/sensors endpoint to list all sensors
- Add GET /api/v1/sensors/:id endpoint for sensor details
- Add GET /api/v1/sensors/:id/data endpoint with time range filtering and aggregation (avg/min/max per hour/day)
- Add POST /api/v1/sensors endpoint for sensor creation (admin only)
- Add POST /api/v1/sensors/:id/data endpoint for adding sensor readings
- Implement WebSocket streaming for real-time sensor data

Background Jobs & Automation:
- Add daily absence warnings cron job (runs at 9 AM)
- Add event reminders cron job (1 day before and 1 hour before)
- Add meal reservation reminders cron job (runs at 6 PM)
- Add database backup cron job (runs daily at 2 AM)
- Add log cleanup cron job (runs weekly on Sunday at 3 AM)
- Add analytics data aggregation cron job (runs daily at 1 AM)

Security & Optimization:
- Enhance rate limiting with stricter limits for auth endpoints
- Add Winston logger for application logging
- Add Morgan middleware for HTTP request logging
- Add input sanitization middleware to prevent XSS attacks
- Improve error logging with detailed context
- Add CORS hardening

Database:
- Add Notification model with category, read status, and user relations
- Add NotificationPreference model for user notification settings
- Add Sensor and SensorData models for IoT integration
- Create migration for Part 4 features (preserves existing data)

Dependencies:
- Add socket.io for WebSocket support
- Add node-cron for scheduled tasks
- Add winston for logging
- Add morgan for HTTP logging
